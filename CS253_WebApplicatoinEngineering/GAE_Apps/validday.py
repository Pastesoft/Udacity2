# # User Instructions
# # 
# # Modify the valid_day() function to verify 
# # whether the string a user enters is a valid 
# # day. The valid_day() function takes as 
# # input a String, and returns either a valid 
# # Int or None. If the passed in String is 
# # not a valid day, return None. 
# # If it is a valid day, then return 
# # the day as an Int, not a String. Don't 
# # worry about months of different length. 
# # Assume a day is valid if it is a number 
# # between 1 and 31.
# # Be careful, the input can be any string 
# # at all, you don't have any guarantees 
# # that the user will input a sensible 
# # day.
# #

def valid_day(day):
  if day and day.isdigit():
    nd = int(day)
    if (nd > 0) and (nd <= 31):
      return nd

print valid_day('0') #=> None    
print valid_day('1') #=> 1
print valid_day('15') #=> 15
print valid_day('500') #=> None
