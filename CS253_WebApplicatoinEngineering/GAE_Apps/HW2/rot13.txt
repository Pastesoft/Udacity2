In order to be graded correctly for this homework, there are a few things to keep in mind.
We'll be grading your web app by POSTing to your form and retrieving the text that has been encoded with ROT13.
There are a few main issues you need to keep in mind in order for this to work:

    The textarea form element where the user inputs the text to encode must be named 'text'.
    In other words, you must have 'textarea name="text"' for us to post to.
    The form method must be POST, not GET.
    You must enter the full url into the supplied textbox above, including the path.
    For example, our example app is running at http://udacity-cs253.appspot.com/unit2/rot13, but if we instead only entered http://udacity-cs253.appspot.com/ then the grading script would not work.
    Don't forget to escape your output!
